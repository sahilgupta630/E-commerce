## About the Project

This website is a front-end-only project that simulates a real e-commerce platform. It includes multiple pages such as a Home Page, Shop Page, Product Details Page, Blog Page, and a Shopping Cart.
The goal of this project was to practice responsive web design, UI/UX principles, and dynamic content handling using JavaScript.

## What I Learned

HTML: Structured web pages using semantic elements like 'header', 'section', and 'footer'.

CSS: Styled the pages using modern layout techniques such as Flexbox and Grid to make them responsive.

JavaScript: Added interactivity like product filtering, adding items to the cart, and handling UI events.

Bootstrap: Learned to use pre-built components for responsiveness and faster design
